# Second Hand E-commerce Platform

Welcome to **Second Hand**, the eco-friendly e-commerce platform designed exclusively for college students! With our platform, students can buy and sell second-hand goods among themselves, creating a sustainable marketplace within their campus. This initiative not only promotes reusing products but also significantly reduces transportation costs as everything is exchanged within the campus itself.
